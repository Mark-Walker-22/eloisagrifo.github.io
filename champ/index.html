The main goal of CHAMPS is to give graduate students and other early career researchers on the academic job market a platform to showcase their research. CHAMPS started as a weekly virtual seminar in Fall 2020, created by <a href=https://eloisagrifo.github.io/>Elo&iacute;sa Grifo</a> and <a href=http://ssather.people.clemson.edu>Keri Sather-Wagstaff</a> and based on an idea by Keri and <a href=https://hughgeller.com>Hugh Geller</a>. In the first two years we had weekly seminars. Since Fall 2022, we profile early-career researchers on our website and release elevator pitch videos on our <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnh5vdfU5zP7q9OqBkix0TA>YouTube channel</a>.

<br><br>

Here are our old pages: <a href=year3.html>2022-2023 profiles</a>, <a href=year2.html>2021-2022</a>, and <a href=year1.html>2020-2021</a>. 
<!--

<div class="profile2">
<a href=https://sites.google.com/view/matthewweaver/home>Matthew Weaver</a> is a postdoc at the University of Notre Dame, working with Claudia Polini. Before that, he was a graduate student at Purdue University, advised by Bernd Ulrich. Matthew's research interests lie at the intersection of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. More specifically, he is interested in the study of blowing-up rings, namely Rees algebras of ideals and modules, and the implications these rings have within the study of syzygies, resolutions of singularities, and regularities of powers of ideals. Moreover, he is also interested in the applications of these rings to implicitization problems arising within the applied sciences, geometric modeling and computer-aided design in particular. As an educator, Matthew has taught numerous courses as a graduate student and as a postdoc. He hopes to continue to teach a wide range of classes and provide a welcoming learning environment for students.

In particular, she focuses on topics related to the Lefschetz Properties and the non-Lefschetz Locus.
Her thesis concerns the non-Lefschetz locus for first cohomology modules of rank 2 vector bundles over P^2, extending the case of complete intersections of height 3. She also investigates analogous questions for higher-degree forms, studying the non-Lefschetz locus of conics.
During her Ph.D. at the University of Notre Dame, Emanuela taught several undergraduate classes, both online and in person. She has also taught Linear Algebra to incarcerated college students as part of the Moreau College Initiative.

Trevor's research involves measuring the behavior of singularities using Frobenius. In particular, he is interested in using ideas from integer programming, convex geometry, and number theory to develop explicit algorithms to compute the F-pure Threshold and Higher F-Thresholds of hypersurfaces. He aims to use his research to better understand the properties of these invariants. In the classroom, Trevor has taken on various roles, ranging from a teaching assistant to even designing his own calculus courses. As an educator, he believes that investing time in the small things goes a long way. In particular, he believes that building trust and rapport with his students is a powerful, yet simple, pedagogical tool. Because of this, Trevor is committed to creating a safe, welcoming environment which contributes to an enriched and fulfilling educational experience.

<a href=https://sites.google.com/view/sebastiancalvo>Sebastian Calvo</a> is a \(5^{\textrm{th}}\) year PhD candidate at Pennsylvania State University. He studies algebraic geometry under the guidance of Jack Huizenga and John Lesieutre. His research area of interest involves studying configurations of hypersurfaces in the projective plane or projective 3-space. In particular, when a configuration exhibits a symmetry group, one can attempt to extract a lot of interesting properties of the arrangement. He has utilized the symmetry of a configuration's group to calculate its Waldschmidt constant, a numerical value that describes the speciality of the configuration and the calculation of which is an active area of research. Coming from a small liberal arts college, Sebastian is fiercely passionate about teaching and equity. He harvests a comfortable learning environment where students see learning as adventurous, asking questions as a learning tool and adapting when faced with difficulty. He has taken several mathematics education courses and he is a member of the mathematics teaching seminar, which discusses pedagogy and practical teaching strategies.
