<div align="justify"> 
CHAMP is a weekly online seminar, with talks given primarily by graduate students in commutative algebra. The goal of this seminar series is to give graduate students and other early career researchers on the job market a platform to give the 50-minute version of their research talk. We will have 50 minute talks on zoom every Wednesday at 3 pm eastern time, followed by 10 minutes of questions and a 30-minute tea room. We will be asking speakers to allow us to record their talk and share it here. Each speaker will also record a 3 to 5 minute elevator pitch to showcase their research. The speakers are all young researchers in search of an academic position.</div>

<H3>
            How can I attend?
</H3>

All talks will happen via zoom. If you would like to attend CHAMP, please register <a href=https://ucr.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0vfu-tqT0pHdCe5IDXfMvR4rU-Q3ny9-fi>here</a>. You will need a zoom account, but only need to register once.



<H3>
            I would like to speak in the seminar, what can I do?
</H3>

While we will invite all the speakers, we realize we may not know all the outstanding young researchers who we should be inviting. If you would like to speak in CHAMP, please help us by filling out <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBQUo-2yKnT2YMr73xLRbFHjXrMDNr3jbNzdNpzR8E5u2gbg/viewform?usp=sf_link>this simple form</a>. We cannot promise to be able to accommodate everyone who would like to speak, but we will do our best to give you an opportunity to speak. Priority will be given to graduate students and to those whose research interests are closest to commutative algebra.
