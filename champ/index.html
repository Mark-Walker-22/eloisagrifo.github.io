The main goal of CHAMPS is to give graduate students and other early career researchers on the academic job market a platform to showcase their research. CHAMPS started as a weekly virtual seminar in Fall 2020, created by <a href=https://eloisagrifo.github.io/>Elo&iacute;sa Grifo</a> and <a href=http://ssather.people.clemson.edu>Keri Sather-Wagstaff</a> and based on an idea by Keri and <a href=https://hughgeller.com>Hugh Geller</a>. In the first two years we had weekly seminars. In Fall 2022 we will profiling early-career researchers on our website and releasing elevator pitch videos on our <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnh5vdfU5zP7q9OqBkix0TA>YouTube channel</a>.

<br><br>

Here are our <a href=year1.html>2020-2021 speakers</a> and our <a href=year2.html>2021-2022 speakers</a>.

<br><br>
All past seminars and elevator pitch videos can be found on <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnh5vdfU5zP7q9OqBkix0TA>our YouTube channel</a>.

If would like to <span style="color:#191970;">recommend</span> an early career researcher in commutative algebra and related fields to speak at CHAMPS, please <a href = "mailto: grifo@unl.edu">contact us</a>.

<a href=https://www.joshpollitz.com>Josh Pollitz</a> is an NSF postdoc at the University of Utah, working with Srikanth Iyengar. He received his PhD from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2019 under the supervision of Luchezar Avramov and Mark Walker. Josh's research interests are in commutative algebra, especially applying homological techniques to acquire ring and module theoretic data. He has had successes applying triangulated category techniques, certain notions of cohomological support, Hochschild cohomology and certain graded Lie algebras associated to rings or maps. As an educator, Josh has taught a variety of courses at all levels of undergraduate mathematics. He puts an emphasis on group work and creating a dynamic and welcoming learning environment.

<a href=https://www.math.ttu.edu/~lferraro/>Luigi Ferraro</a> is a postdoc at Texas Tech University, working with Lars Christensen. He received his PhD from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2017 under the supervision of Luchezar Avramov and Srikanth Iyengar. His research in commutative algebra has focused on the structure of the stable cohomology of a local ring, on the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of graded modules, on the rigidity of Ext and Tor, on the intersection theorems, on grade 3 perfect ideals and on the homotopy Lie algebra of local rings. His research in noncommutative algebra has focused on studying actions of groups and, more generally, actions of Hopf algebras on noncommutative rings and on the study of the homological properties of quotients of skew polyomial rings. As a teacher, Luigi has taught many classes at the undergraduate level, and the first year graduate course of Algebra. His teaching style is to emphasize critical thinking by engaging the students with activities, giving in-class problem sets to work on in groups, and encouraging the students to meet him outside of class in office hours.

<div class="profile2">
<a href=https://sites.google.com/view/rdiethorn>Rachel Diethorn</a> is a Lecturer at Yale University.  She earned her Ph.D. from Syracuse University in 2020 under the supervision of Claudia Miller.  Rachel's research interests are in commutative algebra, especially on its homological aspects.  She is particularly interested in resolutions, their constructions and their applications, and Koszul homology.  In one of her recent publications, Rachel describes the Koszul homology algebra structure of the quotient by the edge ideal of a forest. Rachel has recently developed a new interest in differential operators; in collaboration with Jeffries, Miller, Packauskas, Pollitz, Rahmati, and Vassiliadou she constructs the minimal free resolutions of the modules of differential operators in low order over rings that define surfaces with mild singularities.  Rachel is also an experienced and passionate teacher; she has seven years of experience as the instructor of record for a variety of undergraduate courses and has advised several undergraduate research projects for math majors.  In each course she teaches, Rachel is committed to creating a dynamic and student-centered classroom that invites active learning.

<div class="profile2">
<a href=https://sites.google.com/view/delio-jaramillo-velez/home?authuser=1>Delio Jaramillo-Velez</a> is a PhD candidate at CINVESTAV, Mexico City. His advisor is Rafael H. Villarreal. He was a master student at CIMAT under the supervision of Luis N&uacute;&ntilde;ez-Betancour and Manuel Gonz&aacute;lez Villa. He focuses on Commutative algebra and Coding theory; his research interests include evaluation codes, edge ideals, binomial edge ideals, and singularities in prime characteristic. He has described the v-number of an edge ideal in a combinatorial way, and he has found a necessary condition  for the Cohen-Macaulayness of the second symbolic power of an edge ideal.
Delio has taught several undergraduate courses. He believes that everyone can have joyful mathematical experiences, and he likes to encourage students to discuss and share their ideas with their classmates.

<a href=https://www.math.unl.edu/~jkettinger2/>Jake Kettinger</a> is a PhD candidate at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. His advisor is Brian Harbourne and he completed his master's degree at UNL. Jake focuses on algebraic geometry. His research interests include geproci configurations of points in projective space, unexpected varieties, superabundance of varieties, and fields of positive characteristic. He has found new configurations of geproci sets in prime characteristic of a kind that does not exist in characteristic 0, and is applying quasi-elliptic fibrations to the study of geproci sets in characteristic 2. As an educator, Jake has taught a variety of courses aimed at undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds in math, including education majors. He believes that mathematics is for everyone, and that students learn best when they see math as a collaborative effort instead of a skill passed down from a single authority.
