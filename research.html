My research interests lie in commutative algebra and homological algebra. I am interested in applying homological algebra, characteristic p techniques, and p-derivations to different questions in commutative algebra. I have worked on questions that relate to infinite free resolutions, DG algebras, local cohomology, and symbolic powers. I wrote <a href=https://doi.org/10.18130/V3707WN5T>my PhD thesis</a> under the supervision of Craig Huneke, on the containment problem for symbolic and ordinary powers of ideals over regular rings.

We investigate Demailly's Conjecture for a general set of sufficiently many
points. Demailly's Conjecture generalizes Chudnovsky's Conjecture in providing
a lower bound for the Waldschmidt constant of a set of points in projective
spaces. We also study a containment between symbolic and ordinary powers
conjectured by Harbourne and Huneke that in particular implies Demailly's
bound, and prove that a general version of that containment holds for
determinantal ideals and defining ideals of star configurations.

Building on previous work by the same authors, we show that certain ideals defining Gorenstein rings have expected resurgence, and thus satisfy the stable Harbourne Conjecture. In prime characteristic, we can take any radical ideal defining a Gorenstein ring in a regular ring, provided its symbolic powers are given by saturations with the maximal ideal. While this property is not suitable for reduction to characteristic p, we show that a similar result holds in equicharacteristic 0 under the additional hypothesis that the symbolic Rees algebra of I is noetherian.

We show that when R is a regular ring containing a field, and R/I is Gorenstein, then I has expected resurgence (and thus satisfies Stable Harbourne) as long as R has prime characteristic or the symbolic Rees algebra of I is noetherian.

We give explicit criteria that imply the resurgence of a self-radical ideal in a regular ring is strictly smaller than its codimension, which in turn implies that the stable version of Harbourne's conjecture holds for such ideals. This criterion is used to give several explicit families of such ideals, including the defining ideals of space monomial curves. Other results generalize known theorems concerning when the third symbolic power is in the square of an ideal, and a strong resurgence bound for some classes of space monomial curves.

The symbolic powers I<sup>(n)</sup> of a radical ideal I in a polynomial ring
consist of the functions that vanish up to order n in the variety defined by
I. These do not necessarily coincide with the ordinary algebraic powers
I<sup>n</sup>, but it is natural to compare the two notions. The containment problem
consists of determining the values of $n$ and $m$ for which I<sup>(n)</sup> &sube; I<sup>m</sup> holds. When I is an ideal of height 2 in a regular ring, I<sup>(3)</sup> &sube; I<sup>2</sup>  may fail, but we show that this containment does hold for the
defining ideal of the space monomial curve (t<sup>a</sup>, t<sup>b</sup> t<sup>c</sup>). More generally,
given a radical ideal I of big height h, while the containment
I<sup>(hn-h+1)</sup> &sube; I<sup>n</sup> conjectured by Harbourne does not necessarily hold
for all n, we give sufficient conditions to guarantee such containments for
n sufficiently large.

This is a two part paper: the first half introduces the stable Harbourne Conjecture and provides some evidence towards it; the second half shows that the defining ideals I of space monomial curves (t<sup>a</sup>,t<sup>b</sup>,t<sup>c</sup>) satisfy I<sup>(3)</sup> &sube; I<sup>2</sup>.

The containment problem for symbolic and ordinary powers of ideals asks for what values of a and b we have I<sup>(a)</sup> &sube; I<sup>b</sup>. Over a regular ring, a result by Ein-Lazarsfeld-Smith, Hochster-Huneke, and Ma-Schwede partially answers this question, but the containments it provides are not always best possible. In particular, a tighter containment conjectured by Harbourne has been shown to hold for interesting classes of ideals &mdash; although it does not hold in general. In this paper, we develop a Fedder (respectively, Glassbrenner) type criterion for F-purity (respectively, strong F-regularity) for ideals of finite projective dimension over F-finite Gorenstein rings and use our criteria to extend the prime characteristic results of Grifo-Huneke to singular ambient rings. For ideals of infinite projective dimension, we prove that a variation of the containment still holds, in the spirit of work by Hochster-Huneke and Takagi.

<details><summary><div class="textstyle">abstract</div></summary>In a polynomial ring over a perfect field, the symbolic powers of a prime ideal can be described via differential operators: a classical result by Zariski and Nagata says that the n-th symbolic power of a given prime ideal consists of the elements that vanish up to order n on the corresponding variety. However, this description fails in mixed characteristic. In this paper, we use p-derivations, a notion due to Buium and Joyal, to define a new kind of differential powers in mixed characteristic, and prove that this new object does coincide with the symbolic powers of prime ideals. This seems to be the first application of p-derivations to Commutative Algebra.

Given a radical ideal I in a regular ring R, the containment problem of symbolic and ordinary powers of I consists of determining when the containment I<sup>(a)</sup> &sube; I<sup>b</sup> holds. By work of Ein-Lazersfeld-Smith and Hochster-Huneke, there is a uniform answer to this question, but the resulting containments are not necessarily best possible. We show that a conjecture of Harbourne holds when R/I is F-pure, and prove tighter containments in the case when R/I is strongly F-regular.</details>

We show that over a regular ring R of characteristic p, if R/I is F-pure, then I satisfies Harbourne's Conjecture. We also show a stronger statement holds if R/I is strongly F-regular.

We study associated primes of certain Ext-modules, showing that they are all compatible ideals. Finally, we focus on properties that Lyubeznik numbers detect over a globally F-split projective variety.

For an associative ring R, the level of a perfect complex F is the smallest number of mapping cones needed to build F from add(R). We establish lower bounds of the level of F in terms of the vanishing of homology of F. We then use these bounds to derive an improved version of The New Intersection Theorem for level when R is a commutative local ring containing a field.

The deviations of a graded algebra are a sequence of integers that determine the Poincar&eacute; series of its residue field and arise as the number of generators of certain DG algebras. In a sense, deviations measure how far a ring is from being a complete intersection. In this paper we study extremal deviations among those of algebras with a fixed Hilbert series. In this setting, we prove that, like the Betti numbers, deviations do not decrease when passing to an initial ideal and are maximized by the Lex-segment ideal. We also prove that deviations grow exponentially for Golod rings and for certain quadratic monomial algebras.

Let R=S/I where S=k[T_1,&#8230;,T_n] and I is a homogeneous ideal in S. The acyclic closure R of k over R is a DG algebra resolution obtained by means of Tate's process of adjoining variables to kill cycles. In a similar way one can obtain the minimal model S[X], a DG algebra resolution of R over S. By a theorem of Avramov there is a tight connection between these two resolutions. In this paper we study these two resolutions when I is the edge ideal of a path or a cycle. We determine the behavior of the deviations &epsilon;_i(R), which are the number of variables in R in homological degree i. We apply our results to the study of the k-algebra structure of the Koszul homology of R.

Symbolic powers are a classical commutative algebra topic that relates to primary decomposition, consisting, in some circumstances, of the functions that vanish up to a certain order on a given variety. However, these are notoriously difficult to compute, and there are seemingly simple questions related to symbolic powers that remain open even over polynomial rings. In this paper, we describe a Macaulay2 software package that allows for computations of symbolic powers of ideals and which can be used to study the equality and containment problems, among others.
