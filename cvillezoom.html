            A Zoom Special Session on Commutative Algebra</center>
        </H2>


<ul>


Originally, <a href=http://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2273_program_ss28.html#title>our session</a> was scheduled to be held in Charlottesville, from March 13 to March 15th, 2020. Since the AMS had to cancel the meeting due to CORONAVIRUS concerns, we decided to hold a virtual session. This session will be held on March 21 and 22, on zoom (link soon!).

Transferring dg-algebra structures
<br>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify">
We discuss some history of motivations for and issues arising in transferring algebra structures on complexes along homotopy equivalences. Then we discuss how, under suitably nice homotopy equivalences, a dg-algebra structure descends. Lastly, we discuss a concrete application: we use the homotopy on the tautological Koszul complex given by the weighted de Rham map to build a concrete permutation invariant dg-algebra structure on a well-known resolution. We mention briefly a homological tool called the perturbation lemma used in this application to obtain the needed homotopy equivalencies from the de Rham homotopy. 

This is joint work with Hamid Rahmati.

Uniform symbolic topologies and hypersurfaces
<br>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify">
We show that complete local normal domains satisfy the uniform symbolic topology property if local hypersurface rings have uniform symbolic topologies at regular primes. We also discuss two types of bootstrapping results related to the uniform symbolic topology property. This is joint work with Craig Huneke.

Berger's Conjecture from the viewpoint of an Invariant of the Module of Differentials
<br>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify">
Let R be a commutative 1 dimensional domain whose integral closure is a DVR. For the first part of this talk, we assume further that R is a complete k-algebra where k is any field. Under this hypothesis, there is a long standing conjecture of R.W. Berger which states that R is regular if and only if the (universally finite) differential module &Omega;<sub>R/k</sub> is torsionfree. We introduce an invariant of &Omega;<sub>R/k</sub> and discuss some lower bounds on it which would give some new cases of this conjecture. In particular, we can generalize the quasihomogeneous case proved by Scheja. Finally, we explore some relations between this invariant and the colength of the conductor.

Koszul homology of quotients by edge ideals
<br>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify">
We show that the Koszul homology algebra of a quotient by the edge ideal of a forest is generated by the lowest linear strand. This provides an answer, for such rings, to a question of Avramov about the Koszul homology algebra of Koszul algebras. We also recover a result of Roth and Van Tuyl on the graded Betti numbers of quotients of edge ideals of trees.</p></details>

Minimal resolutions of monomial ideals
<br>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify">
It has been an open problem since the 1960s to construct closed-form, canonical, combinatorial minimal free resolutions of arbitrary monomial ideals in polynomial rings. This talk explains how to solve the problem, in characteristic 0 and almost all positive characteristics, using sums over lattice paths of combinatorial data from simplicial complexes, one simplicial complex for each lattice point. Any minimal free resolution of any monomial ideal must – either implicitly or explicitly – produce homomorphisms between various homology groups of these simplicial complexes. Therefore an important aspect of the solution is an explicit way to write down canonical homomorphisms between these homology groups without choosing bases.

A categorical characterisation of complete intersection homomorphisms
<br>
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify">
In many ways the bounded complexes of finitely generated projective modules control the regular behaviour of a local R. These are sometimes called the "small objects" of D(R). The Auslander-Buchbaum-Serre theorem implies that R is regular iff every object of D<sup>b</sup>(R) is small.

I will talk about the class of "proxy-small objects" in D(R), and how it's becoming clear apparent that these objects control the complete intersection behaviour of R. By results results of Dwyer, Greenlees, and Iyengar, and Pollitz, R is a complete intersection iff every object of D<sup>b</sup>(R) is proxy-small. I will explain how to generalise this to the relative situation: a local homomorphism f: R &rarr; S is complete intersection iff the proxy-small property "ascends along f".

As an application, we can deduce an important result of Avramov about factorisations of complete intersection homorphisms. This is going work with with Srikanth Iyengar, Janina Letz, and Josh Pollitz.
