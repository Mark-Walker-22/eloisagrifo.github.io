<br><br>

This is a seminar in Commutative Algebra, primarily aimed at graduate students who do not yet have a strong background on the subject. Rather than having traditional research talks, our main goal is to introduce the audience to the field; the talks will survey results, techniques and ideas in current commutative algebra research.


<br><br>

In Winter 2020, all talks are happening on zoom; if you'd like to attend, please <a href = "mailto:eloisa.grifo@ucr.edu">contact us</a>.

Rees algebras and multiplicity
<br>
<br>
Abstract:  In this talk I will discuss the Cohen-Macaulay property of Rees algebras. The problem is geometrically motivated by the study of singularities. When blowing up a variety at a singular point, one does not necessarily get a non-singular variety, but at least would hope that the nature of the singularity does not get worse in the process. In particular, since Cohen-Macaulay singularities are very well-behaved, one would wish that the blowup of a Cohen-Macaulay singularity is still Cohen-Macaulay. This is not always true, however some sufficient conditions can be determined by studying the multiplicity of the ring.

Symbolic powers
<br>
<br>
Abstract: Many geometric shapes we might want to study are cut out by polynomial equations; these are called varieties. There is an algebra-geometry correspondence assigning each variety X to the ideal of all the polynomials that vanish at all the points in X. But how do we measure that vanishing? What are the polynomials that vanish on X to order n? What is the smallest degree of such a polynomial?

These and many other questions are answered by studying symbolic powers, which are ubiquitous in commutative algebra. In this talk, we will introduce symbolic powers and briefly discuss some of the open problems about them.

Rees algebras and free resolutions
<br>
<a href=CASeminar/ReesAlgebras1.pdf>talk notes</a>
<br>
<br>
Abstract: Rees algebras appear in algebraic geometry as homogeneous coordinate rings of the blow up of a variety or a scheme at a singular point. In order to understand the algebraic structure of Rees algebras, free resolutions represent a very useful tool. In this talk I will explain how one can use free resolutions to describe the Rees algebra in terms of generators and relations.

FI-algebras
<br>
<br>
Abstract: Consider a polynomial ring with infinitely many variables. "No," you say, "I shan't! That's too many variables" and you are correct. The study of FI-algebras allows us to add notions like finite generation and noetherianity to algebras that are, strictly speaking, way too big.

<br>
Simplicial polytopes and commutative algebra
<br>
<br>
Abstract: In the intersection of commutative algebra, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry, there lives a beautiful theorem called the g-theorem. This theorem asserts that some (finite) sequence of numbers has a specific interpretation coming from simplicial polytopes (combinatorics) if and only if it has a specific interpretation coming from (graded) commutative algebra. The first proof of the forward implication of this theorem, due to Stanley, used the cohomology of toric varieties (algebraic geometry). A later proof, due to McMullen, dodged the algebraic geometry, allowing us to think of this theorem as purely algebro-combinatorial. In this talk, I will describe the g-theorem, and illustrate what it means in examples, using only combinatorics and commutative algebra. If I have time, I will describe some generalizations and conjectures for more algebro-combinatorial gadgets.

Life as a government contractor
<br>
<br>
Abstract:  Before leaving academia I was always intrigued at what life would be like in industry. It turns out, itâ€™s pretty fun! In this talk I will answer questions that I wish I knew as a graduate student. E.g. What is my day like? What type of problems do you work on? Is it selling out to work on government contracts? What could a commutative algebraist do? The answers may surprise you.

Using computer software for commutative algebra research
<br>
<a href=CASeminar/IntroM2.m2>M2 code</a>

<br>
<br>
Abstract: Computer (algebra) software plays a very important role in modern mathematics research, and in particular in commutative algebra. We will talk briefly about why and how such software can be used in research, and introduce <a href=http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/>Macaulay2</a>. We will see Macaulay2 in action, and give an overview of where and how one could learn more about using it.

The friendship between commutative algebra and rational homotopy theory
<br>
<a href=CASeminar/ben.pdf>talk notes</a>
<br>
<br>
Abstract: Starting in the 80s several mathematicians (especially Avramov and Roos) started noticing that some of the things that happen in rational homotopy theory mysteriously also happen in commutative algebra. As more connections were uncovered, eventually the two fields made contact, and even held joint conferences, leading to a lot of process on both sides. The connection between the two areas became known as "the looking glass", and ideas and results have now been passed back and forth through it for decades.
<br>
I'll try to describe some of the main similarities between rational homotopy theory and commutative algebra, and I'll introduce an object called the homotopy Lie algebra, which exists on both sides of the looking glass. It will be as accessible as possible!

Rings of invariants

Combinatorial Commutative Algebra II
<br>
<a href=CASeminar/Alessandra2.pdf>talk notes</a>
<br><br>
Abstract: This is the second of three talks aiming to understand how to use combinatorial properties to understand free resolutions and Betti numbers of ideals in a polynomial ring. In the first part of the talk I will explain how to use combinatorics to understand free resolutions of squarefree monomial ideals, and of monomial ideals that are not square free. If time allows, I will also explain how you can construct ideals generated by monomials or by squarefree monomials starting from any homogeneous ideal.

<a href=CASeminar/Alessandra1.pdf>talk notes</a> (see also <a href=CASeminar/Alessandra04_24_20.pdf>notes from a related previous talk</a>)
<br><br>
Abstract: This is the first of three talks aiming to understand how to use combinatorial properties to understand free resolutions and Betti numbers of ideals in a polynomial ring. I will describe free resolutions of ideals generated by monomials, and in particular by squarefree monomials.

<br><br>
Abstract:  In this talk I'll give lots of examples illustrating what betti numbers say about ideals in a polynomial ring. We will also

Betti numbers and free resolutions
<br>
<a href=CASeminar/Betti.pdf>talk notes</a>
<br> 
<br>
Abstract:
A (minimal) free resolution of a finitely generated module M describes its generators, relations, the relations among the relations, etc, and contains lots of geometric and algebraic information about a module. In this talk, we will give a friendly introduction to free resolutions and construct several examples.
