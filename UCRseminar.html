<br><br>

This is a seminar in Commutative Algebra, primarily aimed at graduate students who do not yet have a strong background on the subject. Rather than having traditional research talks, our main goal is to introduce the audience to the field; the talks will survey results, techniques and ideas in current commutative algebra research.


<br><br>

In Fall 2020, all talks are happening on zoom; if you'd like to attend, please <a href = "mailto:eloisa.grifo@ucr.edu">contact us</a>.

The friendship between commutative algebra and rational homotopy theory
<br>
<br>
Abstract: Starting in the 80s several mathematicians (especially Avramov and Roos) started noticing that some of the things that happen in rational homotopy theory mysteriously also happen in commutative algebra. As more connections were uncovered, eventually the two fields made contact, and even held joint conferences, leading to a lot of process on both sides. The connection between the two areas became known as "the looking glass", and ideas and results have now been passed back and forth through it for decades.
<br>
I'll try to describe some of the main similarities between rational homotopy theory and commutative algebra, and I'll introduce an object called the homotopy Lie algebra, which exists on both sides of the looking glass. It will be as accessible as possible!

Rings of invariants
<br><br>
Abstract: In this talk, we will introduce rings of invariants from a commutative algebra perspective. This is a classical topic with connections to the origins of commutative algebra.

Combinatorial Commutative Algebra II
<br>
<a href=CASeminar/Alessandra2.pdf>talk notes</a>
<br><br>
Abstract: This is the second of three talks aiming to understand how to use combinatorial properties to understand free resolutions and Betti numbers of ideals in a polynomial ring. In the first part of the talk I will explain how to use combinatorics to understand free resolutions of squarefree monomial ideals, and of monomial ideals that are not square free. If time allows, I will also explain how you can construct ideals generated by monomials or by squarefree monomials starting from any homogeneous ideal.

<br><br>
Abstract: This is the first of three talks aiming to understand how to use combinatorial properties to understand free resolutions and Betti numbers of ideals in a polynomial ring. I will describe free resolutions of ideals generated by monomials, and in particular by squarefree monomials. I will also explain how you can construct ideals generated by monomials or by squarefree monomials starting from any homogeneous ideal.

What are Betti Numbers?
<br>
talk notes <a href=CASeminar/Adam1.pdf>part 1</a> and <a href=CASeminar/Adam2.pdf>part 2</a>
<br><br>
Abstract:  In this talk I'll give lots of examples illustrating what betti numbers say about ideals in a polynomial ring. We will also 
talk about conjectures for lower bounds for betti numbers including recent work with Derrick Wigglesworth.

Betti numbers and free resolutions
<br>
<a href=CASeminar/Betti.pdf>talk notes</a>
<br> 
<br>
Abstract:
A (minimal) free resolution of a finitely generated module M describes its generators, relations, the relations among the relations, etc, and contains lots of geometric and algebraic information about a module. In this talk, we will give a friendly introduction to free resolutions and construct several examples.
