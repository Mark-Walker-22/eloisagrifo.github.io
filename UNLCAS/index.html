Note: this is a new page after some issues with the old one; the old seminar announcements will be back online in a few weeks when I manage to restore them to the new format. Thank you for your patience.

<h3>97 years after Macaulay</h3>
</center>

Abstract: In 1927, Macaulay's paper on lex ideals was published. Macaulay proved that for every homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring, there exists a nicely structured ideal (called a lex ideal) with the same Hilbert function. This is the fundamental result on Hilbert function and has influenced both algebra and combinatorics throughout the last century. Unfortunately, the fields that Macaulay founded and influenced have developed separately since the publication of the Clements-Lindstr&ouml;m Theorem in 1969.
<br>
This talk will be about a connection between extremal combinatorics and commutative algebra that will put everything into a single framework. There are several byproducts from this connection. I will deduce old and new results in both fields that give answers to questions posed by Bezrukov, Hoefel, Leck, Mermin and Peeva. Some of these results include other rings in which Macaulay's lex ideal theorem holds, and a classification in this direction.

<h3>Symmetric group fixed quotients of polynomial rings</h3>
</center>

Abstract: Let the symmetric group act on the polynomial ring S in n variables via variable permutation. We consider the quotient module M which sets a monomial equal to all of its images under the action. This is a module over the ring of invariants, with relatively little known about its structure. When using integer coefficients, we can embed M as an ideal inside the ring of symmetric polynomials. Doing so gives rise to a family of ideals - one for each n. Localizing at a prime p reveals striking behavior in these ideals, which stay stable (in a sense) as n grows, but jump in complexity each time n equals a multiple of p. In this talk, we will discuss the construction of this family of ideals, as well as a result and conjecture on its structure. The talk will end with a path forward towards solving the conjecture.
