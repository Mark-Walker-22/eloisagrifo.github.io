<b>Instructor:</b> <a href=https://eloisagrifo.github.io>Elo&iacute;sa Grifo</a> (please address me by my first name)

<b><a href=algebra2.pdf>Class notes</a></b>
&nbsp;
I will be updating these throughout the semester. If you find any typos at all, however small, please let me know.

<b>Basic course info</b>:

This is a sequel to Math 817. We will continue to talk about rings, introduce modules, and discuss topics from field theory including Galois theory and finite fields.

<br><br>

<b>Prerequisites:</b> Math 817.


<br><br>
<b>Course expectations:</b> 
Attendance is expected, as much as possible, but please do NOT attend class if you are feeling ill or may have been exposed to COVID-19. 

You are encouraged to work on the problem sets together in groups, or discuss them with me; you should however write up your own solutions. The only other resources you are allowed to use to solve the problem sets are our class notes and the textbook. There will be a midterm and a final exam, both in-person. 


<br><br>
<b>Office Hours:</b> 
You can just drop by my office anytime, or write me an email if you'd like to set up an appointment.
<br>
I am definitely going to be in my office and available to talk to you on <b>Mondays 4-5:30+</b> and <b>Fridays 10-11</b>.
<br>
(The + means that I will stay later whenever there are students in my office, but will leave at 5:35ish if I'm alone)

<b>Instructions:</b> 
You are welcome to work together on the problems, and I will be happy to give you hints or discuss the problems with you, but you should write up your solutions by yourself. You will submit each problem set on canvas as a pdf file.
