<b>Basic course info</b>:

This is a sequel to Math 817. We will continue to talk about rings, introduce modules, and discuss topics from field theory including Galois theory and finite fields.

<br><br>

<b>Prerequisites:</b> Math 817.


<br><br>
<b>Course expectations:</b> 
Attendance is expected, as much as possible, but please do NOT attend class if you are feeling ill or may have been exposed to COVID-19. 

You are encouraged to work on the problem sets together in groups, or discuss them with me; you should however write up your own solutions. The only other resources you are allowed to use to solve the problem sets are our class notes and the textbook. There will be a midterm and a final exam, both in-person. 


<br><br>
<b>Office Hours:</b> 
TBD. You can also just drop by my office anytime, or write me an email if you'd like to set up an appointment.

<b>Instructions:</b> 
You are welcome to work together on the problems, and I will be happy to give you hints or discuss the problems with you, but you should write up your solutions by yourself. You will submit each problem set on canvas as a pdf file.
