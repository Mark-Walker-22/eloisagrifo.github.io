Welcome!
<br><br>
Symbolic powers are a classical topic that appears ubiquitously throughout commutative algebra. This is a course on symbolic powers and their connections to various topics in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. You might take this class because you like symbolic powers and want to learn more about them, or just as an excuse to learn more commutative algebra. This will be a commutative algebra II of sorts, covering various classical topics within the field using symbolic powers as a connecting mechanism. We will talk about what symbolic powers are, how to compute them (and the difficulties of doing so), and some of the main open problems in the area, including equality, the containment problem, bounding minimal degrees, and finite generation of symbolic Rees algebras. We will discuss how symbolic powers can be used to prove theorems that are <i>not</i> about symbolic powers, but also how to apply various tools from across commutative algebra to studying symbolic powers. Topics will include:
<li> Monomial ideals and some basic combinatorial commutative algebra </li>
<li> Some elementary classical algebraic geometry, including projective varieties</li>
<li> Rees algebras </li>
<li> Characteristic p techniques</li>
<li> Regular sequences </li>
<li> Basics of regular rings and Cohen-Macaulay rings.</li>



<br><br>
Computing examples can be quite difficult. We will learn a little bit about how we can use <a href=http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/>Macaulay2</a> to do calculations; I will not assume you've ever used Macaulay2 before. As surprising as it may sound, we <i>can</i> use a computer to do very abstract calculations!

<br><br><br>

<b>Prerequisites:</b> A basic course in commutative algebra, such as Math 902.




<br><br>
<b>Course expectations:</b> 
Attendance is expected, as much as possible, but please do NOT attend class if you are feeling ill or may have been exposed to COVID-19. 

There will be problem sets, which you are very welcome to (read: encouraged to!) discuss with me and collaborate on with your classmates; you should however write your own solutions. Your final grade will be based on the problems you turn in, although attendance will also be taken into account.



<br><br>
<b>Office Hours:</b> 
Just drop by my office whenever, or write me an email if you'd like to set up an appointment. I'm usually around between 8:30 am and 5 pm on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, and occasionally on Mondays and Fridays.

<b>Instructions:</b> 
You are welcome to work together on the problems, and I will be happy to give you hints or discuss the problems with you, but you should write up your solutions by yourself. 


Your submissions should include two files:
<li>The written problems should be in a pdf file, but you are not required to type your solutions. If you prefer to handwrite your work on paper, there are apps like Scannable or Genius Scan that can scan your work into one pdf.
</li>
<li>Any Macaulay2 work you want to submit should preferably be in a .m2 file. If you are a windows user and have to use <a href=https://www.unimelb-macaulay2.cloud.edu.au>Macaulay2 online</a>, please copy your work (inputs only) to a txt file, and then rename it to be a .m2 file. You can include written comments on your Macaulay2 work in your pdf as well. 
</li>

<br>


I'll give you 5 problem sets, some of which might include some Macaulay2 work, and a separate list of introductory Macaulay2 problems. You can include problems from the introductory M2 problems list with any problem set submission. If you've never used Macaulay2 before, you're welcome to pick all your Macaulay2 problems from the introductory Macaulay2 problems list. To receive an A in the course, you must turn in 20 problems you put a reasonable amount of effort into, and satisfying the following:
<li>At least 5 of the problems you turn in involve some Macaulay2 work.</li>
<li>You turn in problems from at least 4 different problem sets.</li>
<li>At least half of the problems you turn in involve some amount of writing (as opposed to only Macaulay2 code).</li>
