Welcome to Commutative Algebra!
<br><br>
This course will be an introduction to commutative algebra, and will continue through the Spring quarter with a course called Homological Algebra. 
<br><br>

This first course is an introduction to commutative algebra, a subject that has interactions with algebraic geometry, number theory, combinatorics, category theory, representation theory, and several complex variables. The emphasis will be on Noetherian rings. Topics will include the Noetherian property, integral extensions, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz and the basic dictionary between commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, Noether normalization, localization, chains of prime ideals, Krull dimension, Artinian rings, normal Noetherian rings, flatness, primary decomposition, symbolic powers, and the Krull height theorem. We will learn and use some elementary homological algebra throughout the course.

<br><br>
The course will also include a brief introduction to <a href=http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/>Macaulay2</a>. Macaulay2 is a software system devoted to supporting research in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. We will briefly discuss how one can use computer software in pure math research, and try some very elementary examples in Macaulay2.

<br><br><br>

<b>Prerequisites:</b> The official prerequisite is the Algebra sequence at UCR. If you have taken an introduction to ring theory somewhere else, I will allow you to enroll as long as you convince me you have enough background to follow.
If you are less than comfortable with the definition of a module over a ring (or lack some guiding examples) and/or are less than somewhat OK with free modules, I encourage you to quickly review these notions. While we will introduce them in class, having some familiarity with these notions will be helpful. A friendly source is Dummit and Foote, 10.1-10.4. It will also be helpful, but not required, that you have some familiarity with exact sequences.


<br><br><br>
<b>Text:</b> I will be posting course notes throughout the quarter. We will not follow any particular textbook, but recommended sources include:

<br><br>
<li>Introduction to Commutative Algebra, by Atiyah and Macdonald</li>
<li><a href=>Mel Hochster's lecture notes</a> (the Fall 2020 version)</li>
<li>Jack Jeffries's lecture notes (<a href=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jackjeff/CAnotes.pdf>2018</a> and <a href=https://jack-jeffries.github.io/CAnotes.pdf>2019</a> versions), and</li>
<li>Commutative Ring Theory, by Matsumura</li>

<br><br>
<b>Course expectations:</b> 
Attendance is expected. There will be 4 or 5 problem sets, which you are very welcome to (read: encouraged to!) work on together in groups; you should however write your own solutions to the problem sets. Your final grade will be based on the problem sets, although attendance will also be taken into account.
